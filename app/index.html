		<h1>Code blog</h1>

		<p>Hello, world! This is <a href="https://curly.kiwi" target="_blank">Mark Hanna</a>'s code blog.</p>

		<p>Does this blog look pretty bare bones? That's on purpose.</p>

		<p>I've been meaning to start a coding blog for years, but each time I try I want to do too many cool things with it. But perfect is the enemy of good, and I never get anything off the ground.</p>

		<p>This is my solution for now: no cool things. Just writing, and barely enough CSS for that writing to be readable. At least it's something. I can always come back later and add some cool things.</p>
